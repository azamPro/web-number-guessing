# Number Guessing Game

## Description

I have developed an interactive and engaging Number Guessing Game as part of my portfolio. This web-based game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The project is a combination of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the dynamic functionality.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The game boasts a clean and intuitive user interface designed with HTML and styled using CSS. The layout is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Range Setting:** Players can set the range of numbers they want to guess from, adding an extra layer of difficulty or simplicity to the game. This feature is implemented with JavaScript for dynamic updates.

- **Real-time Feedback:** As users input their guesses, the game provides immediate feedback on whether the correct number is higher or lower. This creates an engaging and interactive experience.

- **Winning Celebration:** Upon successfully guessing the correct number, a winning message is displayed, celebrating the player's accomplishment. The styling and animations enhance the overall user experience.

- **Reset and Play Again:** For a continuous gaming experience, players can reset the game and play again with a new randomly generated number. The 'Play Again' button is strategically placed for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Responsible for structuring the game, including the input forms and result displays.

- **CSS:** Adds an aesthetic touch to the game with a visually appealing layout and responsive design.

- **JavaScript:** Powers the game's functionality, including the generation of random numbers, user input validation, and real-time feedback.
